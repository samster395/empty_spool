# Empty 3D printer filament spool weight database
Useful to work out how much filament is left on the spool.

[samster395.github.io/empty_spool/](https://samster395.github.io/empty_spool/)

The wiki that used to hold this data is no longer available, luckily [Greenonline on stack exchange](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/23154/46763) posted the table, I used that to make this page that is searchable etc.

## Don't see your Spool Brand?

Weigh it when it's empty and submit an issue with the spool addition label and I'll add it.
